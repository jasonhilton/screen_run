How flat is a length scale of 2? (the default limit in km)

Covariance kernel is

$$
c(\pmb{x_i}, \pmb{x_j}) = \sigma^{2} \exp( -\sum_k\frac{(x_ik - x_jk)^2}{2\theta_k^{2}})
$$


The covariance structure is seperable, so we can think in one dimension.
We scale the input to lie between 0-1.

So the maximum distance x_i-x_j is 1, and assuming \theta hits the limit of 2, we have 
a correlation 

$$
r(x_i, x_j) = \exp\left(-\frac{(x_{i} - x_j)^2}{2\theta^{2}}\right) \\
= \exp(-1/8)
$$
which is `r exp(-1/8)`


We can simulate from this, assuming sd of 1 and mean =0

```{r}

library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)

x <- seq(0,1,0.01)

C <- exp(-as.matrix(dist(x)**2)/8) + diag(1e-6, length(x)) # for stability

sims <- t(map(1:10, function(x) t(chol(C)) %*% rnorm(dim(C)[1])))
ylims<-c(max(map_dbl(sims, max)),min(map_dbl(sims, min)))

plot(x,sims[[1]], ylim=ylims, type="l")
walk(sims, function(y) lines(x,y))


```


This is quite flat but probably not flat enough.
